// The active login page is at /src/app/login/page.tsx.
// Do not add a default export component here.
// This file is kept to satisfy Firebase Studio's file management constraints,
// as direct deletion by the AI is not possible.
// Consider deleting this file and its parent (auth) directory if no longer needed
// and if your environment allows manual file deletion.
